# Auto Version Control Rules - Claude AI

You are a senior software developer. These rules override your default behavior. Follow them on every action without being asked.

## Rule 0: Always Read First

Before taking any action on this project — including edits, commits, or file creation:

1. Read `.claude/CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/CODING_NOTES.md`.
2. Run `gh pr list` — if a PR exists for the current branch, run `gh pr view <number> --comments` and read **all comments** (CodeRabbit and human) before proceeding.
3. Run `gh issue list` — check for open issues relevant to the current work.
4. Do not make any edits until all outstanding findings and review comments are addressed or acknowledged.

No exceptions.

### Checking PR review status

`.claude/CODING_NOTES.md` is a standards and practices reference — a log of coding patterns and past findings, grouped by topic. It is **not** the source of truth for PR review status.

- To check if a PR review is complete or paused: **always use `gh pr view <number> --comments`**.
- CodeRabbit may auto-pause reviews after rapid commits — check for `review paused` in the summary comment.
- If paused, trigger a new run with: `gh pr comment <number> --body "@coderabbitai review"`
- If CR hits a rate limit (`Rate limit exceeded`), run `date -u` to get the current UTC time, calculate the UTC timestamp when the window clears, and state it explicitly (e.g. "clears at 05:04 UTC"). Re-trigger on the first user interaction at least 5 minutes after that time to allow for clock drift.
- **Sequential PR workflow:** Open one PR (as a draft — see Rule 4), get the user's explicit approval to mark it ready, wait for CR to finish and address all findings, merge, then open the next. Do not trigger multiple concurrent CodeRabbit reviews.
- CodeRabbit's default configuration does not auto-review draft PRs — marking a PR ready for review (`gh pr ready <number>`) is what triggers its first review, not PR creation. Don't expect or wait for CodeRabbit comments while a PR is still in draft.

## Trigger Prompt

When the user says **"run auto version control"** (or any close variation like "run avc", "auto version control", "start version control"), immediately run the full assessment:

1. Run `git status`, `git branch`, and `git log --oneline -10`
2. Run `gh issue list` and report any open issues
3. Report the current state: branch, uncommitted changes, recent commits, version tags
4. Flag any issues: working on main, uncommitted changes, missing .gitignore, no tags
5. Recommend next actions

This is how the user explicitly asks you to check in on the project.

## Rule 1: Git Is Mandatory

- If the project is not a git repository, run `git init` and create an initial commit before doing anything else.
- Never work directly on `master`. Always create a feature branch first, then merge into `master` via PR.
- Branch naming: `feat/description`, `fix/description`, `refactor/description`, `docs/description`, `chore/description`, `ci/description`.
- If you are on `master` when you start, create and switch to a feature branch immediately.

## Rule 2: Conventional Commits

Every commit message must follow this format:

```
type: short description (imperative, lowercase, no period)
```

Valid types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `style`, `perf`, `chore`, `ci`, `build`.

Examples:
- `feat: add user authentication endpoint`
- `fix: prevent null pointer in payment handler`
- `refactor: extract validation logic into shared module`
- `docs: add API usage examples to README`

Rules:
- One logical change per commit. Do not bundle unrelated changes.
- Commit after every meaningful change, not at the end of a long session.
- If a commit touches more than 3 unrelated things, you are bundling too much. Split it.
- If a new feature is added or changed, update the top-level README.md before committing.
- After every commit, check if a PR exists for the current branch (`gh pr list --head <branch>`). If none exists, open one immediately via `gh pr create --draft`. Never leave a commit on a feature branch without an open PR.

## Rule 3: Semantic Versioning

Update GitHub releases on minor version changes to the production branch.

Tag releases using `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`:
- **MAJOR** — breaking changes (removed features, changed APIs, incompatible updates)
- **MINOR** — new features that do not break existing functionality
- **PATCH** — bug fixes, typo corrections, minor improvements

**To cut a release:**
```bash
git tag v1.2.3
git push origin v1.2.3
```

**Note:** Only tag from `master`.

### Automatic Version Bump Triggers

After every merge to `master`, count commits since the last `v*` tag:

```bash
last_tag=$(git describe --tags --abbrev=0 2>/dev/null)
if [ -n "$last_tag" ]; then
  git log "$last_tag"..master --oneline
else
  git log master --oneline
fi
```

Count by type:
- Lines starting with `feat:` → feature count
- Lines starting with `fix:` → fix count

**Thresholds:**
- **5 or more `feat:` commits** → recommend a MINOR bump
- **5 or more `fix:` commits** → recommend a PATCH bump

If both thresholds are met simultaneously, recommend MINOR (takes precedence). This is a
*recommendation*, not an action — wait for the user's explicit go-ahead before tagging.

Check this threshold after every merge to master and report the recommendation. Do not wait for the
user to ask before reporting it — but do wait for their sign-off before acting on it.

## Rule 4: Pull Request Reviews

When a pull request is open or being prepared:

- Always open PRs via `gh pr create --draft` — never merge directly to `master` without a PR.
- **New PRs start as drafts and stay in draft until the user explicitly approves making them active.** Only run `gh pr ready <number>` after that explicit go-ahead — never mark a PR ready for review on your own judgment, even if CI is green and all findings are addressed. Readiness for human/CodeRabbit review is the user's call, not something to infer from the state of the code.
- After any review is submitted (CodeRabbit **or human**), read all comments before making any further changes.
- For each finding, regardless of source:
  1. If it matches an existing `.claude/CODING_NOTES.md` entry — fix it immediately and reference the note's topic in the commit message.
  2. If it is a new pattern — fix it, then add or amend a note under the relevant topic in `.claude/CODING_NOTES.md` before committing, following that file's style rule (clear, ≤300 characters, grouped by topic).
- Do not dismiss or ignore nitpicks — log them to `.claude/CODING_NOTES.md` even if not immediately actionable.
- Only merge a PR after all blocking comments are resolved and documentation has been updated.
